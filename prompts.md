# Prompts Used

1. "I want to build an application which connects to a Snowflake public data set for FEMA disaster declarations. I have already generated an account for Snowflake and can see the data in Notebooks but will need help building programmatic access to this data. I will then utilize Streamlit and Plotly to render the data on a map of the USA. Then I will integrate Cortex AI to build an ability to query the data in natural language inside the application."
2. "Please also generate a README.md and a prompts.md. In the prompts.md, please include the prompts I used to build this application."
3. "Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself. To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos."
