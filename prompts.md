# Prompts Used

1. "I want to build an application which connects to a Snowflake public data set for FEMA disaster declarations. I have already generated an account for Snowflake and can see the data in Notebooks but will need help building programmatic access to this data. I will then utilize Streamlit and Plotly to render the data on a map of the USA. Then I will integrate Cortex AI to build an ability to query the data in natural language inside the application."
2. "Please also generate a README.md and a prompts.md. In the prompts.md, please include the prompts I used to build this application."
3. "Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself. To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos."
4. "Please update to store credentials and secrets in a separate file which will not be uploaded to Github."
5. "Apply the changes."
6. "How should I collect the information for secrets.env from Snowflake?"
7. "The public data set actually has views - not tables. Should the code be updated?"
8. "Apply the changes."
9. "Yes, update it."
10. "I may need to use any one of these views. Please update accordingly."
11. "Should the provided views also appear in the secrets.env file?"
12. "Run the application and demonstrate it's able to pull back data from Snowflake public data."
13. "The webpage displays this error: Failed to read year range: 000904 (42000): SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 24 invalid identifier 'DECLARATION_DATE'"
